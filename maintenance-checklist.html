                <p>Regular maintenance is the key to extending your vehicle's life and avoiding costly repairs. At Vesla Auto Services, we've created this comprehensive maintenance checklist to help you keep track of essential service items and their recommended intervals. Following this guide will help ensure your car remains reliable, safe, and performs at its best.</p>
                
                <h2>Monthly Maintenance Tasks</h2>
                <p>These simple checks should become a monthly habit for every car owner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tire pressure check:</strong> Proper inflation improves fuel economy, extends tire life, and enhances safety. Check when tires are cold using a reliable pressure gauge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual tire inspection:</strong> Look for signs of uneven wear, cuts, bulges, or embedded objects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oil level check:</strong> Ensure your engine oil is at the appropriate level. Low oil can cause severe engine damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Coolant level check:</strong> Verify that your engine coolant is between the minimum and maximum marks on the reservoir.</li>
                    <li><strong>Windshield washer fluid:</strong> Top up as needed to maintain good visibility in all driving conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights check:</strong> Ensure all exterior lights (headlights, brake lights, turn signals) are functioning correctly.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Every 3 Months or 5,000 kilometers</h2>
                <p>These checks should be performed quarterly or every 5,000 kilometers, whichever comes first:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check battery and terminals:</strong> Clean any corrosion and ensure connections are tight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect belts and hoses:</strong> Look for cracks, fraying, or signs of wear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check air filter:</strong> A clean air filter improves engine performance and fuel efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rotate tires:</strong> Regular rotation ensures even wear and extends tire life.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check brake fluid level:</strong> Ensure it's at the proper level and hasn't darkened significantly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test wiper blades:</strong> Replace if they streak or skip across the windshield.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Every 6 Months or 10,000 kilometers</h2>
                <p>Twice-yearly inspections and services to keep your car in optimal condition:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Oil and filter change:</strong> This is the most important maintenance task for your engine's longevity. Modern synthetic oils may allow longer intervals, but we recommend changing every 10,000 kilometers for most vehicles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check chassis lubrication:</strong> Proper lubrication prevents premature wear of suspension and steering components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect exhaust system:</strong> Look for rusting, leaks, or loose components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check power steering fluid:</strong> Ensure proper level and condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect suspension components:</strong> Check for worn parts that could affect handling and comfort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Test battery performance:</strong> Weak batteries often fail in extreme temperatures.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Annual Maintenance or Every 20,000 kilometers</h2>
                <p>These more comprehensive checks and services should be performed annually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brake inspection:</strong> Check pads, rotors, and overall brake system condition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooling system service:</strong> Inspect for leaks, test antifreeze strength, and check the thermostat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transmission fluid check:</strong> Verify level and condition; consider changing if dirty or at recommended interval.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fuel system inspection:</strong> Check for leaks, damaged lines, or a clogged fuel filter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replace cabin air filter:</strong> Ensures clean air inside your vehicle and proper HVAC performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check spark plugs:</strong> Modern plugs last longer, but should still be inspected annually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wheel alignment check:</strong> Improper alignment causes uneven tire wear and affects handling.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Every 2-3 Years or 40,000-60,000 kilometers</h2>
                <p>These less frequent but critical services help prevent major repairs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Replace brake fluid:</strong> Brake fluid absorbs moisture over time, which can lead to brake failure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Flush cooling system:</strong> Removes contaminants and prevents corrosion inside the engine.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replace transmission fluid:</strong> Essential for automatic transmissions, especially those used in stop-and-go traffic or harsh conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replace spark plugs:</strong> Modern plugs can last 100,000 kilometers, but check your owner's manual for specifics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Replace drive belts:</strong> Prevents unexpected breakdowns and damage to other components.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspect suspension bushings:</strong> Worn bushings affect handling and comfort.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Vehicle-Specific Maintenance</h2>
                <p>While our checklist covers general maintenance for most vehicles, always consult your owner's manual for model-specific requirements. Different vehicles may have additional maintenance needs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Timing belt replacement:</strong> Typically required every 100,000 kilometers on vehicles equipped with timing belts (not chains).</li>
                    <li><strong>Diesel engines:</strong> May require fuel filter changes more frequently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Turbo vehicles:</strong> Often need more frequent oil changes with specific oil types.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hybrid vehicles:</strong> Have unique maintenance requirements for their electrical systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance vehicles:</strong> May have more stringent service intervals.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Maintenance Based on Driving Conditions</h2>
                <p>Your driving environment dramatically affects maintenance needs. Consider more frequent service intervals if you experience any of these conditions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Extreme heat:</strong> Dubai's hot climate puts additional stress on cooling systems, batteries, and fluids.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dusty conditions:</strong> Desert environments require more frequent air filter and fluid changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Short trips:</strong> Engines that don't reach operating temperature regularly need more frequent oil changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heavy traffic:</strong> Stop-and-go driving increases wear on brakes and transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Heavy loads:</strong> Regularly carrying heavy loads or towing increases strain on all systems.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Professional vs. DIY Maintenance</h2>
                <p>While some maintenance tasks are suitable for DIY enthusiasts, others require professional equipment and expertise:</p>
                <p><strong>DIY-friendly tasks:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Checking fluid levels</li>
                    <li>Replacing wiper blades</li>
                    <li>Changing air filters</li>
                    <li>Battery maintenance</li>
                    <li>Tire pressure checks</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Leave to the professionals:</strong></p>
                <ul>
